# 3D-Portfolio Using Unity

This is the source code of my 3D Portolio made with Unity. To see the result, check [this](ugobalducci.fr) !
All 3d Assets are free to use, mostly homemade using Illustrator and Blender.

### HomePage
This is the part of my portfolio that required WebGL. This an idea I had when I came across a design in [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/11205741-Learning-Tech?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=tannerwayment&utm_content=Learning%20Tech&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=tannerwayment&utm_content=Learning%20Tech&utm_medium=Social_Share).
I wanted to challenge myself by doing this interactive page also inspired by another [great portfolio](https://jesse-zhou.com/). I still need to improve the UX and the way people navigate on the site, but my main guideline is to make my portfolio reflect my passion for interactive content.

### Other Pages
You can access the source code of other pages on the /docs/ folder, which contains a ready to use copy of the WebGL Build, as well as the rest of the webpages.
